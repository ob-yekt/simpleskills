## 🎣 Skill Highlights: Your Path to Mastery

Here’s a taste of what each skill offers:

### Fishing
- **Faster Catches**: +0.5% speed per level (up to +49.5% at 99).
- **Fully Reworked Loot Tables**: Unlock better treasures as you level:

| Tier               | Fish | Junk | Treasure |  
|--------------------|------|------|----------|  
| Novice (1–24)      | 70%  | 25%  | 5%       |  
| Journeyman (25–49) | 70%  | 22%  | 8%       |  
| Artisan (50–74)    | 70%  | 19%  | 11%      |  
| Expert (75–98)     | 70%  | 16%  | 14%      |  
| Grandmaster (99)   | 70%  | 10%  | 20%      |

Each tier has a handmade loot table that ensures a balanced and exciting fishing experience.

### NOTICE!
**If you use a fishing mod that changes loot tables, set "custom_fishing_loot_enabled" to false in config.json and restart the server.**

---

### Enchanting
Lock powerful enchantments from being used at an anvil to specific levels, defaulted to:
- Fortune III: Level 25
- Sharpness V: Level 50
- Power V: Level 50
- Efficiency IV: Level 15
- Efficiency V: Level 75
- Mending: Level 99

No more rushing and cycling trades for Mending villagers; you have to earn it! You can also offer your enchanting services to other players, creating an economy.

Enchanting XP is earned through applying enchantments to items on an Anvil or Enchanting Table.

Enchanting Table XP logic:

`int XP = multiplier * level * level;`

So:
* 1 level as the enchantment table cost → 50 × 1² = 50 XP -> 100 XP with standard mode XP multiplier (2x)
* 10 levels as the enchantment table cost → 50 × 10² = 5,000 XP -> 10,000 XP with standard mode XP multiplier (2x)
* 30 levels as the enchantment table cost → 50 × 30² = 45,000 XP -> 90,000 XP with standard mode XP multiplier (2x)

Customizable by adjusting `enchantment_xp_per_level_squared": 100` in enchantment_requirements.json

---

### Cooking
